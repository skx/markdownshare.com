      <h1>Markdown Sharing</h1>
      <blockquote>
        <p>This site allows you to easily share Markdown-formatted text, allowing others to view the nicely rendered result.</p>
        <p>In short this is a "markdown-using pastebin" site.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There is no charge to use the site.</li>
          <li>You don't need to create an account.
            <ul>
              <li>If you make a mistake and upload content you didn't mean to you can delete it.</li>
              <li>Once you've uploaded your markdown you can return in the future and edit it.</li>
              <li>Uploaded text automatically has an obfusticated URL to avoid spidering attempts.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>There are no arbitrary restrictions on uploaded content.</li>
          <li>There is full support for emoji in your content:
            <ul>
              <li>For example <tt>:smile:</tt>, <tt>:mute:</tt>, <tt>:plus1:</tt>, etc.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The code behind the site is open, and if you wish you can easily install your own copy.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Get started <a href="/create">sharing your markdown</a> is very easy, just visit the <a href="/create/">create link</a> and away you go.</p>
        <p>If you prefer to submit without using a browser that is possible, via our simple <a href="/api/">submission API</a> which supports the use of HTTP-POSTS, or command-line clients such as <tt>pastebinit</tt>.</p>
