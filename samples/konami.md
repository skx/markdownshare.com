(Or you were given a link to this page :wink: - generally you'd get here by entering the code on any valid page on this site.)

# Bonus Feature : Emoji

If you've found this page you should know that the markdown formatter supports the use of emoji, simply use `:name:` and this will be replaced with the appropriate image.

The name must be a valid emoji term, as unrecognized names will be rendered unchanged.

Valid names include the obvious:

| Emokis Name | Rendered Image |
|:-----------:|:--------------:|
|`angel`      | :angel:        |
|`apple`      | :apple:        |
|`bike`       | :bike:         |
|`boy`        | :boy:          |
|`cake`       | :cake:         |
|`cat`        | :cat:          |
|`dog`        | :dog:          |
|`girl`       | :girl:         |
|`kiss`       | :kiss:         |
|`older_man`  | :older_man:    |
|`older_woman`| :older_woman:  |
|`penguin`    | :penguin:      |
|`smile`      | :smile:        |



## About This Page

This page is present to prove that [Steve Kemp](https://steve.kemp.fi/),
developed, wrote, and deployed this website.

Unfortunately some people will insist that their installations of my
projects are official and _home-made_ despite that not being the case.

This is the unspoken downside of open-source releases; people will rebrand
your work, typically without understanding it or examining it in depth.
Easter eggs like this are useful in that context.
